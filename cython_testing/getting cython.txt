If you have a package manager (e.g. apt-get), use that to install python's 'setuptools' and 'pip'. It's also available on cygwin's setup.exe

If you don't have apt-get or cygwin, but are using a Mac, execute this (as root) on the terminal:
$ wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.7.7/ez_setup.py -O - | python

If you were able to install pip with the package manager, execute this:
$ pip install cython

Otherwise, execute:
$ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
$ python get-pip.py
$ pip install cython
